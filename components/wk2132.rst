The WK2132 component allows you to use the 
`Weika WK2332-ISSG <https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Interface-Specialized_WEIKAI-WK2132-ISSG_C401039.html>`__
chip or the DFROBOT `Gravity: I²C to Dual UART Module <https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2001.html>`__
module directly in ESPHome. 

This WK2132 chip/module is an I²C to Dual UART with data transmission rate up to 1 Mbps. Each UART channel has independent 
256-byte FIFO hardware buffer for transmitting and receiving. The baud rate and check format of every 
UART channel can be set independently. Note that the data bit length is equal to 8 and cannot be changed.
The module provides 2 Mbps maximum communication rate. \ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
Documentation about the DFRobot module can be found at the 
`DFROBOT Wiki <https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity%3A%20IIC%20to%20Dual%20UART%20Module%20SKU%3A%20DFR0627>`__

At most four such modules can be connected onto one I²C controller board to expand to 8 
hardware serial ports. The base addresses for these boards depend on state of two
switches placed on the board: A0 and A1. \ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
Once configured, you can use the UART channels to connect your UART Devices. 
Each channel acts, for the connected component, as a virtual UART Bus.

.. important:: 
  The addresses indicated above are called the base address of the component. But in reality the component
  uses 8 consecutive addresses starting from the base address. For example if the component base address 
  is 0x10 it will occupy the addresses from 0x10 to 0x17 on the I²C bus. \ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
  This is important to know if you want to connect other devices on the same I²C bus.

.. caution:: 
  Currently, due to some internal limitation, it is necessary to declare a ``uart:`` component in
  your configuration **even if you do not need one**. See the example above. This requirement 
  might disappear in the future.

Choosing an I²C to UART components
**********************************
There are two components in the ESPHome library that allow you to add a number 
of UART channels from an I2C bus. This allows you to connect a large number of 
devices that communicate with rs232 interface via a single I²C bus. 
These two components are

- The sc16is75x component, which lets you use sc16is750 chips 
  or breakbooards, as well as sc16is752 chips and breakboards. 
  Up to 4 of these boards can be on an I²C bus simultaneously.
- The wk2132 component, which lets you use wk2132 chips or 
  DFRobot `Gravity: I²C to Dual UART Module. <https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2001.html>`__ 
  Up to 4 of these boards can be on an I²C bus simultaneously.

The following table compares the characteristics of these different components to help 
you choose the most suitable one for your application.

(1) Boards based on SC16IS75X have a voltage regulator and are normally 
    designed for 5 V power supply. However, experience has shown that they 
    work correctly with a 3.3 V power supply.
(2) If the component is used correctly, the size of the FIFO 
    is not irrelevant. However, a larger FIFO size provides a certain 
    safety margin.

Component configuration variables:
**********************************

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id to use for this WK2312 component.
- **address** (*Optional*): The I²C address of this component. Defaults to ``0x10``.
- **i2c_id** (*Optional*): The I²C Bus ID. Defaults to the default i²c bus.
- **crystal** (*Optional*): The frequency in Hz of the crystal connected to the chip.
  If you are using DFROBOT modules, the frequency of the crystal  does not need to be specified. 
  it will be set automatically to 14745600 Hz.
- **uart** (*Optional*): The UART Buses. This parameter is optional but it must be specified if 
  you want to use any of the UART on the component!

  - **uart_id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id to use for this virtual UART Bus.
  - **channel** (*Optional*): The channel number to use for this virtual UART Bus. Default to ``0``.
    Obviously if you are using both channels they must use different channel number (i.e. ``0`` and ``1``)
  - **baud_rate** (**Required**): The baud rate of the UART bus.
  - **parity** (*Optional*): The parity used on the UART bus. Options: ``NONE``, ``EVEN``, ``ODD``. Defaults to ``NONE``.
  - **stop_bits** (*Optional*): The number of stop bits to send. Options: ``1``, ``2``. Defaults to ``1``.
