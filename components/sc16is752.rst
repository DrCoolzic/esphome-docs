The SC16IS752 component allows you to use SC16IS750
(`Datasheet <https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/SC16IS740_750_760.pdf>`__)
or SC16IS752 (`Datasheet <https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/SC16IS752_SC16IS762.pdf>`__)
chips or breakout-boards in ESPHome. 

The SC16IS750 is a slave I²C chip that provides a single-channel high
performance UART while the SC16IS752 provides a dual-channel UART. 
Both models offers data rates up to 5 Mbit/s. They also provides 8 additional 
programmable I/O pins.

The breakout-boards can be found at
`SC16IS750 board <https://www.aliexpress.com/premium/sc16is750-board.html>`__
and `SC16IS752 board <https://www.aliexpress.com/premium/sc16is752-board.html>`__

.. note:: 
  A SC16IS750 breakout-board is equipped with a MIC5219 LG33 voltage regulator, 
  which provides 3.3V to the chip and a 14.7456MHz crystal.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
  A SC16IS752 breakout-board is equipped with a AMS1117-3.3 voltage regulator, 
  which provides 3.3V to the chip and a 3.072Mhz crystal.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`

.. warning:: 
  **Due to the fact that these boards are equipped with voltage regulator they must 
  must be powered with 5v (3.3v won't work)**. \ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
  The level of i2c pins is 3.3V, but all pins are 5V tolerant.

  SC16IS750 and SC16IS752 Breakout boards
.. note:: 
  The range of possible addresses for these boards are ``0x90`` to ``0xAE``.
  The actual choice of  depends on state of the 2 address pins A0-A1. 
  Please see the table below to set the I²C device address for the boards.
  A mixture of **up to sixteen** of these boards can reside on the same I²C bus.

  Once configured, you can use any of the UART channels (2 for SC16IS752
  board) in your projects. Each channel acts for the connected components as a 
  virtual UART Bus. You can also use any of the 8 GPIO pins (pin number ``0-7``). 
  Any option accepting a :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>` can theoretically 
  be used, but some more complicated components that do communication through 
  this I/O expander will not work.

Component configuration variables:
**********************************

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id to use for this SC16IS752 component.
- **address** (*Optional*): The I²C address of this component. Defaults to ``0x90``.
- **i2c_id** (*Optional*): The I²C Bus ID. Defaults to the default i²c bus.
- **model** (*Optional*): The board's model: ``sc16is750``, or ``sc16is752``). Defaults to ``sc16is752``.
- **crystal** (*Optional*): The frequency in Hz of the crystal connected to the chip.
  If you are using one of the breakout-boards described above, the frequency of the crystal 
  does not need to be specified. For a sc16is750 board the crystal will be set to 14745600
  and for a sc16is752 board the crystal will be set to 3072000. If you are building your own board
  you need to specify the value of the crystal connected to the chip.
- **uart** (*Optional*): The UART Buses. This optional parameter must be specified if you want
  to use the UART functionality of the component.

  - **uart_id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id to use for this virtual UART Bus.
  - **channel** (*Optional*): The channel number to use for this virtual UART Bus. Default to ``0``.
    A sc16is750 has only one channel ``0`` and therefore in that case you do not need to specify it.
    A sc16is752 has two possible channels and therefore in that case if you use the channel 1 it needs
    to be specified. Obviously if you are using both channels they must use different channel number 
    (i.e. ``0`` and ``1``)
  - **baud_rate** (**Required**): The baud rate of the UART bus.
  - **data_bits** (*Optional*): The number of data bits used on the UART bus. Options: ``5`` to ``8``. Defaults to ``8``.
  - **parity** (*Optional*): The parity used on the UART bus. Options: ``NONE``, ``EVEN``, ``ODD``. Defaults to ``NONE``.
  - **stop_bits** (*Optional*): The number of stop bits to send. Options: ``1``, ``2``. Defaults to ``1``.

.. warning:: 
  It seems that some older sc16750 breakout-boards used a different crystal (12.288 MHz). Therefore check 
  carefully the value of the crystal and if it is different from the default specified above use the 
  **crystal** configuration variable

Pin configuration variables:
****************************

- **sc16is752** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id of the ``SC16IS752`` component of the pin.
- **number** (**Required**): The pin number (``0`` to ``7``)
- **inverted** (*Optional*): If all read and written values should be treated as inverted. Defaults to ``false``.
- **mode** (*Optional*): A pin mode to set for the pin at. One of ``INPUT`` or ``OUTPUT``. Default to ``INPUT``
